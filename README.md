# Nobel Prize Analysis Project
The Nobel Prize is one of the most prestigious awards in the world, given annually to scientists, scholars, and activists in the categories of chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In this project, we analyze the Nobel Prize dataset that covers the winners from 1901 to 2016, to uncover interesting insights and patterns about the prize and its recipients.

## Data Overview
The Nobel Prize Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize in 1901 to 2016. We used this dataset to answer the following questions:

Who gets the Nobel Prize?
USA Dominance
Gender of Nobel Prize Winners
First Woman to Win the Nobel Prize
Repeat Laureates
Age of Nobel Prize Winners
Age Differences between Prize Categories
Oldest and Youngest Winners

## Results

Our analysis revealed that the most common Nobel laureate between 1901 and 2016 was a man born in the United States of America.
The USA started to dominate the Nobel Prize charts in the 1930s and has maintained the leading position since then.
We found that men have been the dominant group among Nobel Prize winners, with a significant imbalance in the number of male and female winners. The imbalance is particularly pronounced in the categories of physics, economics, and chemistry.
The first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the prize in physics for discovering radiation and in chemistry for isolating radium and polonium.
Some scientists, writers, and activists have won the Nobel Prize more than once, including Marie Curie, John Bardeen, and Linus Carl Pauling.
Our analysis revealed that the average age of Nobel Prize winners has increased over time, from around 55 in the early 1900s to around 65 today.
The trends in the ages of winners vary between different prize categories, with the average age for physics and medicine winners increasing over time, while the average age for peace winners has decreased.
The youngest winner ever is Malala Yousafzai, who won the peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17, while the oldest winner is Leonid Hurwicz, who won the economics prize at the age of 90.
## Conclusion

Our analysis of the Nobel Prize dataset provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of the prize and its recipients. While some aspects of the prize, such as the dominance of men and the USA, are not surprising, others, such as the increase in the average age of winners and the trend towards greater gender balance in certain categories, are interesting to observe. Regardless, this project serves as a testament to the many brilliant and impactful individuals who have been recognized with the Nobel Prize over the years.
